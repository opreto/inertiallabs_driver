# Inertial Labs Driver

This packaged was copied from https://us.inertiallabs.com:31443/scm/ins/inertiallabs-ros2-pkgs.git
on April 1st, 2026. On April 6th, 2026, the website was no longer accessible. 

Changes:
- Made all publishers optional thru params
  - parameter options:
    - publish_imu_data <- this is what we want
    - publish_sensor_data
    - publish_ins_data
    - publish_gps_data  
    - publish_gnss_data
    - publish_marine_data
- Added a new publisher that puts the 9 DOF imu data in the same message (was split across two separate subscriptions)
  - If this wasn't done, the consumer would have to receive to separate messages and align timestamps to combine them

# inertiallabs_ros2_pkgs
Linux ROS driver for [Inertial Labs](https://inertiallabs.com/) products.
Supported devices: INS, IMU-P, AHRS, AHRS-10.

The package is developed based on the official `SDK v0.2` for Linux.

The package is tested on:
- [ROS2 Humble Hawksbill](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Installation.html) with Ubuntu 22.04 LTS
- [ROS2 Iron Irwini](https://docs.ros.org/en/iron/Installation/Ubuntu-Install-Debs.html) with Ubuntu 22.04 LTS

## License
* The license for the official SDK is the MIT license.
* The license for the other codes is Apache 2.0 whenever not specified.

## Build
It builds by colcon build-system.
Make sure that your folder with ROS2 packages included in environment variable `ROS_PACKAGE_PATH`.
Clone your package in `<your_work_space>/src`.
And build with the Colcon.

```bash
cd <your_work_space>/src
git clone https://us.inertiallabs.com:31443/scm/ins/inertiallabs-ros2-pkgs.git
cd <your_work_space>
colcon build
```

## Run
```bash
sudo chmod 666 /dev/ttyUSB0
sudo stty -F /dev/ttyUSB0 115200
source install/setup.bash
ros2 run inertiallabs_ins il_ins --ros-args -p ins_url:=serial:/dev/ttyUSB0:115200 -p ins_output_format:=51
```

For ins OPVT2AHR packet via USB serial port:
```bash
ros2 run inertiallabs_ins il_ins --ros-args -p ins_url:=serial:/dev/ttyUSB0:115200 -p ins_output_format:=88
```
For ins OPVT packet via UDP (INS hostname is used):
```bash
ros2 run inertiallabs_ins il_ins --ros-args -p ins_url:=udp:INS-F2001234:23 -p ins_output_format:=82
```
For ins OPVT packet via UDP (INS IP address is used):
```bash
ros2 run inertiallabs_ins il_ins --ros-args -p ins_url:=udp:192.168.0.249:23 -p ins_output_format:=82
```

**Parameters**

`ins_url` (`string`, `default: serial:/dev/ttyUSB0:460800`)
Port the device is connected to. Can be:
- serial:[path to device]:[baudrate]
- tcp:[hostname or address]:[tcp server port]
- udp:[hostname or address]:[udp server port]

Inertial Labs Driver supports serial connection.

## FAQ
1. **I use WSL2 with Linux and can't receive data from sensor.**\
You need to use [usbipd](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/connect-usb#install-the-usbipd-win-project). It allows to transfer data from USB to WSL2. And `/dev/ttyUSBx` devices will appear in Linux.
Run PowerShell as Administrator and make something like:
```powershell
# Mount USB:
usbipd list
usbipd bind --busid 1-1
usbipd attach --wsl --busid 1-1

# Unmount USB:
usbipd detach --busid 1-1
```

2. **The driver can't open my serial device?**\
Make sure you have enough access to `/dev`.
```bash
sudo chmod 666 /dev/ttyUSB0
```

3. **Why I have permission error during the initialization process of the driver?**\
Most often, this is because the baud rate you set does not match the package size to be received. Try increase the baud rate.
```bash
sudo stty -F /dev/ttyUSB0 460800
ros2 run inertiallabs_ins il_ins --ros-args -p ins_url:=serial:/dev/ttyUSB0:460800 -p ins_output_format:=88
```

4. **How can I check data from sensor?**\
Be sure, that Inertial Labs node has the topic-subscribers. Because messages will not send with no topic subscribers!

Print topic example:
In the separate windows run
```bash
source install/setup.bash
ros2 topic list
ros2 topic echo /Inertial_Labs/sensor_data
```

5. **Why is the IMU data output rate much lower than what is set?**\
This may be due to a recent change in the FTDI USB-Serial driver in the Linux kernel, the following shell script might help:
```bash
# Reduce latency in the FTDI serial-USB kernel driver to 1ms
# This is required due to https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/c6dce262
for file in $(ls /sys/bus/usb-serial/devices/); do
  value=`cat /sys/bus/usb-serial/devices/$file/latency_timer`
  if [ $value -gt 1 ]; then
    echo "Setting low_latency mode for $file"
    sudo sh -c "echo 1 > /sys/bus/usb-serial/devices/$file/latency_timer"
  fi
done
```

6. **Why a field value is always zero?**\
Most likely, because this field is not provided in the selected INS data packet. The most versatile data packet is User-Defined Data, which allows to order any set of fields
